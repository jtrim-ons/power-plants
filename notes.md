# Notes on the power plant visualisation

## Ideas for improvements

- Add a toggle between capacity and annual generation
- Add map zoom controls
- See if this kind of map can be done in Mapbox
- Perhaps: Scrollytelling, possibly also showing bar charts by country or fuel
- Use label positions (e.g. from Natural Earth) as a better location for aggregated country dots
